* OTV Odysee Terminal Viewer
For all you command line hippies. That have also decided to try getting off of youtube. Which siphens your data constantly. I present to you a odysee search engine in the command line of course. The scripts get there search results from lighthouse.lbry.com. And then plugs into your video player of choice. There is both a Dmenu Version of this script and a Command Line Version of this script.
